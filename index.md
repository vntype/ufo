# The Unified Font Object (UFO) is a cross-platform, cross-application, human readable, future proof format for storing font data.

### The UFO Design Philosophy

* The data must be human readable and human editable.
* The data should be application independent.
* Data duplication should be avoided unless absolutely necessary.
